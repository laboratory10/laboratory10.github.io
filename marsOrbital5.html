In 1999, the Mars Orbiter Camera onboard the Mars Global Surveyor (1996)  also imaged this site with its Wide Angle lens, at around 236 meters per pixel. This was followed by the Thermal Emission Imaging System on Mars Odyssey (2001), which also provided a visible camera producing the image we see here at 17 meters per pixel. Later in 2012, the High-Resolution Stereo Camera on the Mars Express orbiter (2003) captured this image of the surface at 25 meters per pixel. In 2010, the Context Camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2005) imaged this site at about 5 meters per pixel. \n\r\nFinally, in 2017, HiRISE acquired the highest resolution image of this location to date at 50 centimeters per pixel.

All of these repeated impacts tend to wear down the sand grains, smoothing them into a more spherical shape and breaking off small fragments that supply the vast dust deposits of Mars. This process (known as comminution) ultimately destroys sand grains and limits the length of time that the particles exist.

Sand sheets likewise mantle the ground as a relatively thin deposit.\n\r\nThis kind of environment has been monitored by HiRISE since 2007 to look for movement in the ripples covering the dunes and sheets.

Our image shows regions of geologic diversity within, making this an interesting spot for scientists to study how different Martian processes interact with each other.\n\r\nGullies, or channels formed by fluids such as water or lava, cut into the rim and sides of this crater. The presence of gullies can reveal clues about the ancient history of Mars, such as the amount of flowing fluid needed to form them and roughly how long ago that happened. This crater may also host features actively changing on the surface of Mars known as \u201crecurring slope lineae\u201d (RSL). Manifesting as dark streaks on steep slopes such as the walls of craters, scientists posit briny flows of small volumes of water as a possible RSL formation method. Studying the behavior of RSL further may provide evidence for the presence of water on Mars today.\n\r\nMoving toward the crater floor, one can observe patterns indicative of dunes. Dunes arise from the breakdown of exposed rocks by wind and subsequent manipulation of the eroded sand particles into wave-like structures. The presence of dust devil tracks provides additional evidence for significant wind activity at this location. These dunes are very dusty and so likely haven't been active (moved) in some time.\n\r\nHiRISE also captured a small, relatively fresh crater on the floor near the dunes. One of the most ubiquitous processes in the solar system, impact cratering can drastically change the surface of a planetary body. As such, craters provide sources of comparison between planets, moons, and other bodies across the solar system. Impacts still occur today, helping scientists find relative ages of different areas of a planet and discover materials buried under the surface.\n\r\nAll of these processes have altered the surface of Mars in the past and continue to do so today.

At the higher resolution of HiRISE, the image reveals a landscape peppered by small impact craters. \n\r\nThese craters range from about 30 meters in diameter down to the resolution limit (about 2 meter diameter in this image acquired by averaging 2x2 picture elements). Such dense clusters of small craters are frequently formed by secondary craters, caused by the impact of material that was excavated and ejected from the surface of Mars during the creation of a larger nearby crater by the impact of a comet or an asteroid.\n\r\nSecondary impact craters are both interesting and vexing. They are interesting because they show the trajectories of the material that was ejected from the primary impact with the greatest speeds, typically material from near the surface of the blast zone. Secondary craters are often found along the traces of crater rays, linear features that extend radially from fresh impact craters and can reach many crater diameters in length. Secondary craters can be useful when crater rays are visible and the small craters can be associated with a particular primary impact crater. They can be used to constrain the age of the surface where they fell, since the surface must be older than the impact event. The age of the crater can be approximately estimated from the probability of an impact that produced a crater of such a size within a given area of Mars over a given time period.\n\r\nBut these secondary craters can also be perplexing when no crater rays are preserved and a source crater is not easily identifiable, as is the case here. The impact that formed these secondary craters took place long enough ago that their association with a particular crater has been erased.

Deeply incised canyons such as this are excellent targets for studying the Martian crust, as the walls may reveal many distinct types of bedrock.\n\r\nThis section of the canyon was targeted by HiRISE based on a previous spectral detection of hematite-rich deposits in the area. Hematite, a common iron-oxide mineral, was first identified here by the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). In this TES image, red pixels indicate higher abundances of hematite, while the blue and green pixels represent different types of volcanic rocks (e.g., basalt).  \n\r\nHematite in the Meridiani Planum region was also detected with the TES instrument (which we can see with the bright red spot on the Global TES mineral map.). As a consequence, Meridiani Planum was the first landing site selected on Mars due to the spectral detection of a mineral that may have formed in the presence of liquid water.\n\r\nShortly after landing, the Opportunity rover detected the presence of hematite in the form of concretions called \"blueberries\". The blueberries are found in association with layers of sulfate salt-rich rocks. The salts are hypothesized to have formed through the raising and lowering of the groundwater table. During one such an event, the rock altered to form the hematite-rich blueberries. As the rock was eroded away, the more resistant hematite-rich blueberries were plucked out and concentrated on the plains as a \"lag\" deposit. Martian blueberries are observed to be scattered across the plains of Meridiani along Opportunity's traverse from Eagle Crater to Endeavor Crater, where Opportunity continues to explore after its mission began over 10 years ago. \n\nThis infrared-color image close-up highlights what is possibly the hematite-rich deposits nestled between different types of bedrock terraces in Capri Chasma. The bluish terrace is likely volcanic in origin, possibly basaltic, whereas the greenish rocks remain unidentified. \n\r\nThe central reddish terrace is possibly where some of the hematite may be concentrated. The higher elevation terrace with the lighter-colored materials is likely a sulfate-rich rock (based on CRISM data in the area).  Given the presence of both sulfate salts and hematite in this area, akin to the deposits and associations explored by the Opportunity rover in Meridiani Planum, it might be that these materials in Capri Chasma may share a similar origin.\n\r\nThe yellow rectangular box shown on the TES spectral map outlines the corresponding location of the HiRISE image.

Recent studies suggest that RSL may form through the flow of briny (extremely salty) liquid water that can be stable on the surface of Mars even under current climatic conditions for a limited time in summer when it is relatively warm.\n\r\nHow can we distinguish between conventional slope streaks like the ones we see here and RSL? There are many criteria. For instance, RSL are usually smaller in size than regular slope streaks. However, one of the most important conditions is seasonal behavior, since RSL appear to be active only in summer while regular slope streaks can be active anytime of the year. \n\r\nThis site is monitored regularly by HiRISE scientists because of the high density of slope streaks and their different sizes and orientations.

These pit craters are usually appear in the younger Tharsis volcanic region, but this is one of the first seen in the older Elysium volcanic region.\n\r\nGarden variety craters are excavated by impacts and are characterized by raised rims, sloped walls and surrounded by ejecta blankets, but pit craters are simply sink holes in the ground with near vertical walls and floors that are only visible when the sun is high in the sky.

Lava tube collapse may begin with the buckling of its roof at one location where the roof is thinnest. At this point, light enters into the permanent darkness of the cave from above, forming a skylight. Pits or skylights are distinct from impact craters: they appear as dark, roughly circular shadowed holes because of their steep walls, while the shadows cast by impact craters generally shade only a portion of the crater floor, because the slopes of the walls are shallower.

We acquired the image back in April and you can view it here. With this second image, you can download both images and try spotting any changes.\n\r\nOne of the main objectives of the HiRISE camera is to carry out \u201cmonitoring science\u201d, which means we usually take images of certain areas of high scientific interest on regular intervals. We usually do so to monitor a seasonal or recurring process such as melting of ice in spring in the polar regions, dune monitoring, or recurring slope lineae.

One of the techniques we usually use is to image a certain site of interest at least twice when the weather conditions are similar, but with a small difference in viewing angle, much like what you would experience if you looked at something with only your right eye, then looked at it again with the left. By doing this, we are able to build a \u201cstereo view\u201d of the site, providing a chance to identify high and low points in the site more effectively. Another useful technique is to combine these two images using elevation data from laser altimeters to create a highly accurate \u201cdigital terrain model\u201d or DTM for short.\n\r\nDTMs allow us to view the locations in 3D and to analyze them by measuring the exact height of features that could be hazardous to the future mission such as large boulders or small impact craters. DTMs from HiRISE were a key factor in choosing the landing site for Curiosity in Gale Crater and are extensively being used as well to choose sites for the 2016 InSight lander and Mars 2020 rover missions.

So far, the dunes in these craters appear to be a mixed bunch, with some dunes actively advancing while others seem to be frozen in place. This image will be compared to a previous picture, to see how these dunes have changed since 2008.\n\r\nThe sand dunes are the large, branched ridges and dark patches that are conspicuous against the bright background, particularly in the northwest corner of our picture. There are also signs of two other wind-related processes: smaller, brighter ridges line the floor of the crater in regularly spaced rows. These are also windblown deposits, mysterious \u201ctransverse aeolian ridges\u201d or TARs that are more common in the Martian tropics. Faint, irregular dark lines cross the dunes and the TARs, marking the tracks of dust devils that vacuum the surface during southern summer. So, which came first? We can untangle the history of these processes by looking at the picture more closely.\n\r\nOver most of the image, it is obvious that the dark sand dunes bury the bright TARs, meaning that the sand dunes are younger than the TARs. But this relationship is not so clear for the southernmost dune we see in this picture. Here, the TARs look like they extend into the dune and merge with ripples on the dune\u2019s surface, suggesting that the TARs might be younger than the dunes. The question can be resolved by carefully examining an enhanced color cutout. The TARs are brighter and redder than the sand dunes and this color persists on the crests of the TARs as the sand encroaches, burying the valleys first and then the slopes and finally the TAR crests. This tells us that the unusual appearance of the dune margin is caused by burial and exposure of the older TARs by the younger sand.

These streaks are long, thin dark-toned features. They appear when the superficial light-tone fine-grained materials (i.e., Martian dust) suddenly move down slope and expose the darker underlying volcanic surfaces. Repeat imaging shows that dust streaks are consistently dark when they are initially formed and become lighter over time. This is due to the steady deposition of dust from the atmosphere. Slope streaks are also visible along the slopes of ridges and shallow depressions. \n\nTwo ridges here exhibit partially exposed bedrock.

The flows emanate from the relatively bright bedrock and flow onto sandy fans, where they are remarkably straight, following linear channels. Valles Marineris contains more of these flows than everywhere else on Mars combined, and they are always active although on changing slope aspects with season.

However, when a circular depression is visible on the summit of a mound or an elevated landform in general, careful analysis is needed to identify whether the crater is created by an impact or by volcanic activity. \n\r\nThis issue becomes even more problematic when the crater is located in a area known for its volcanic history such as the Apollinaris region where this image was taken and is very close to the prominent volcano Apollinaris Mons. \n\r\nIn fact, this classical problem has been encountered before here on Earth in the case of the famous Meteor Crater in Arizona just outside of the city of Flagstaff. Back in the late 19th century, many people believed that Meteor Crater was a volcanic crater because of its proximity to the San Francisco volcanic field and the rarity of impact craters on Earth.\n\r\nMeteor Crater remained controversial until the 1960s when scientists were finally able to confirm that the crater was indeed an impact crater by identifying minerals in the crater site that can only form in extremely high pressures, which are usually associated with violent impact events.\n\r\nIn the absence of such \u201cground truth\u201d or lab analysis, how can planetary scientists differentiate between impact and volcanic craters? There are a number of ways. For example, impact craters usually exhibit raised rims and distinctive ejecta patterns around the crater, formed by materials ejected during the impact event. Large craters (more than 7 kilometers-wide in general for Mars) exhibit central peaks that form due the rebound of the ground right after impact. All these features are not usually observed in volcanic craters. In this observation, none of these features is visible.

Simply put, salts usually form by evaporation of liquid water. Most salts can easily dissolve in water, and if that water evaporates away completely, the salt is left behind as a deposit or residue. The larger the amount of salts initially dissolved, the larger the salt deposit left behind when the water evaporates. So when scientists look for regions on Mars that have noticeable salt deposits, they are effectively looking for areas that may have contained liquid water in the past.\n\r\nA few years ago, a group of scientists found more than 600 locations on Mars that may contain chloride salts, which could be very similar to  common table salt. Since then, scientists have been using the HiRISE camera to look at these locations more closely and they have found out that many of these locations are very similar to dried lakes on Earth, which are sometimes called \u201cplayas\u201d or \u201csalt pans.\u201d Many such playas can be visited in California and Arizona such as the Racetrack playa and the Death Valley National Park. \n\nIn this image, the chlorides have a bright appearance and are covered by other dark materials.

Barchan dunes are common on Mars and in the desert regions of the Earth. \n\r\nThese barchan dunes are located on the western rim of the Hellas impact basin, in the Southern Hemisphere of Mars.

Mars\u2019 obliquity is currently about 25 degrees, which is not much different from Earth's 23 degrees. However, numerical calculations by scientists at the Paris Observatory and Massachusetts Institute of Technology  suggest that this near-agreement is a coincidence. \n\r\nUnder the influence of gravitational torques from other planets, Mars\u2019 obliquity varies chaotically, probably reaching values greater than 60 degrees and lower than 10 degrees. By contrast, Earth\u2019s obliquity appears to have been limited to small variations from its current value because of the stabilizing gravitational influence of the Moon. If the calculations are correct, then for most of the Solar System\u2019s history, the obliquity of Mars was greater than 25 degrees. This would produce warmer summers and colder winters than on present-day Mars. On Earth, a recent 1 degree rise in obliquity is believed to have triggered ice sheet retreat from the current location of New York City to Greenland. The climatic consequences of 50 degree changes in obliquity on Mars remain unknown. \n\r\nIt is possible, though unproven, that higher obliquity triggered partial melting of some of Mars\u2019 water ice. Our best chance at understanding this is to find piles of ice, dust, silt or sand that accumulated over many cycles of obliquity change. Chemical, mineralogical and isotopic variations within those piles could then offer clues to about past climate changes. On Mars, sediment layers of near-uniform thickness visible from orbit are a fingerprint of deposits that record many cycles of obliquity change.\n\r\nThis HiRISE image of an east-facing slope in Tithonium Chasma was taken to follow up an earlier Context Camera image that seemed to show sediment layers of near-uniform thickness. These sediment layers are the dark and light stripes that run diagonally across the center of the observation. In this top-down view, afternoon sunlight picks out subtle east-west trending ridges in the east-facing slope. The dark and light stripes appear to deflect to the east (downslope) across the ridges. To a geologist, this outcrop pattern shows that the dip of the ancient sediment layers is gentler than the slope of the modern hillside.

They stop abruptly, break up into blocky segments that sometimes appear offset. Such mixed up fragments give an initial sense that parts of the flow have been rafted apart from one another. Alternatively, the entire region may be substantially eroded since the time when the taffy-like ridges actually formed. In that case, the flow may have been far more complex and three dimensional, such that the disconnected portions are actually areas where the flow transitioned up and down relative to the current plane of the eroded surface.

These layers reveal a past ancient environment where geologic material (perhaps volcanic ash, fine sand, and dust) settled slowly from the air or at the bottom of a standing body of water.

Two cracks form at distinctive angles, and the material between the cracks collapses downward, forming a straight-walled canyon. Well, they're usually straight-walled, but this one is circular, which is unusual.\n\r\nThe first thing anyone thinks of when they see circular features on Mars is a crater. So one hypothesis about how this formed is that an ancient crater was buried by some material, maybe lava or even multiple layers of wet sediments. Because the center of the crater was deeper, more material settled there, and the high-standing rim was only thinly covered. The mantling material solidified and shrank, creating extensional forces.\n\r\nThe heavy central fill pulled downward, cracking the material at the rim where it was thinnest.

This height refers to the top of the disconnected dust clouds above the plume; the continuous column of dust reached about half that altitude. Despite its gargantuan height, the plume is only 140 meters (140 yards) in diameter, giving it a snake-like appearance that is twisted by high altitude winds, similar to another dust devil spotted recently in this region.\n\r\nTypical tornadoes on Earth are less than 10 miles tall, while dust devils on our planet seldom reach more than a few hundred yards in height. So, why do we classify this plume as a monster dust devil and not a Martian tornado? Dust devils differ from tornadoes in their energy sources. Dust devils are driven by the heat of the surface, absorbed from sunlight and re-radiated to warm the atmosphere. The warm air rises and spins as it contracts, much as a figure skater spins faster as she draws her arms to her sides. \n\r\nTornadoes have an additional energy source: the heat given off as water vapor condenses into liquid rain. The condensing water vapor produces the visible part of a tornado, called the condensation funnel, which is made up of water droplets. On Mars, there is too little water vapor in the atmosphere to contribute significantly to atmospheric convection on local scales. The cloud that we see in this image is produced by dust particles, not raindrops. The astounding heights of Martian dust devils are made possible because mass of an atmospheric column on Mars is less than 1 percent than that of a column on Earth. Transfer of heat from the surface into this less dense atmosphere can produce more vigorous convection, which will penetrate higher into the Martian atmosphere than its counterparts do on Earth.\n\r\nNow, what would happen if you were caught in its path? Because the density of Mars' atmosphere is so low, even a high velocity dust devil is unlikely to knock you over. However, you might be blasted by any sand or dust particles carried along by the dust devil, which might scratch the visor of your space suit quickly if you were caught outside by this monster!\n\r\nThis vortex left behind a bright track as its winds disturbed the dust-covered surface, tracing the path of the dust devil from the northwest towards the southeast.

Unconsolidated sediments were formed in the canyon by impact fragmentation and erosion of the steep canyon walls.

The parachutes are still easy to spot at the MER and Pathfinder landing sites, so dust deposition over the past eight years probably would not disguise the bright feature over equatorial regions of Mars. At high latitudes the brightness patterns are reset each winter by the seasonal deposits of carbon-dioxide and dust, as seen at the Phoenix landing site.  However, beware of bright cosmic-ray hits.\n\r\nEDL on Mars is difficult! Only the United States has succeeded, with Viking 1, Viking 2, Mars Pathfinder, Spirit, Opportunity, and Phoenix. The 1999 Mars Polar lander was a failure, as was Beagle 2 and six landing attempts by the former Soviet Union. One of the Soviet landers, Mars 3, made it to the surface and transmitted some data or noise for 20 seconds before failure.  We haven't been able to locate any of the Soviet lander hardware from HiRISE images.\n\r\nSearching for this hardware is like looking for a needle in a really big haystack, and we don't know what the needle looks like. In August 2012 NASA will attempt to land the biggest rover ever sent to Mars, MSL or Curiosity.

Dust devils can also kick lots of dust into the air where the dust can absorb sun light passing through the atmosphere, thus warming the atmosphere more directly. \n\r\nMany images show tell-tale dark streaks that crisscross and wiggle all over the surface.

First of all, there are lots of little knobs and plateaus that may expose layers of sedimentary rock. As on Earth, sedimentary rock on Mars is expected to hold clues to the conditions under which it formed - clues to the past environment and climate.\n\r\nSecond, many of the larger, darker plateaus appear fairly round. Typically Mars' surface is pock-marked with round depressions of impact craters. However, these round areas are raised up relative to the surroundings. This may be an example of inverted topography, in which an impact depression may have become filled with material which was, or became, harder than the surrounding terrain, and thus was more resistant to later erosion. Example materials may be solidified molten rock created during the impact event, or sediments that hardened due to alteration by water ponding within the crater.\n\r\nThird, clay minerals, called phyllosilicates, have been detected here by other spacecraft instruments. Clays are exciting because they indicate there was most likely water around here long ago.

This is because they are different ages.  Can you tell which is older?  \n\r\nSometimes you can tell something about relative ages using a geologic principle called \"superposition.\" This means that something that formed later than another feature will overlie the older feature. For example, a younger crater would have its ejecta emplaced on top of an older crater.  That particular situation is not very obvious in this image, although you might be able to see hints of it if you look closely at the high-resolution JPEG2000.\n\r\nThere are still a few more obvious clues to their relative ages, though.  The larger crater (approximately 45 meters, or 150 feet across) is shallower relative to its size, and it has a rim that is more subdued and \"softer\" looking. It also has a distinct texture on its floor. These could be ripples or small dunes formed by air-blown dust or sand, which would require a long time to form.  The smaller crater (10 meters, 30 feet across) does not appear to have any such patterns in its floor, indicating that it is probably younger.\n\r\nAnother clue is the dark area surrounding the smaller crater. This is an area where either lighter surface dust was removed by the impact event, or where darker ejecta was blown out of the crater, forming extended streaks.  You can even see very tiny grooves extending radially from the smaller crater, where material was thrown out at a low angle, scraping the surface or creating lines of tiny \"secondary\" craters where clumps of ejecta impacted the surface. These types of features are very fresh. They do not last a long time on the Martian surface, where wind blows dust around and fairly quickly (in a geologic sense) erases or covers up fine features like these. So these are more clues that the smaller crater is relatively young and fresh-looking.\n\r\nIf this were not enough evidence, we also happen to have an image of this spot from 2005. This image from HRSC (the High Resolution Stereo Camera on the Mars Express spacecraft) shows the same scene, and the dark area around the smaller crater had not yet formed when that image was taken.

From examining the texture of the surrounding plains and the crater floor, we can conclude that a large lava flow overtopped and cut through a low part of the crater rim and then flowed down the wall of the crater and onto the crater floor, incising (cutting) a channel as it went. This observation is focused on the channel, but a portion of the ponded lava on the crater floor is also visible. \n\r\nIf you want to get a better look at the crater floor, check out this CTX image  and this really neat anaglyph.

Since part of the science rationale for taking this observation was to find the relative heights of the ponded lava surface and the surrounding plains as well as to measure the depth of the channel, this site was chosen for stereo coverage.

That doesn't seem likely, as we can see windblown deposits inside the crater, which requires at least thousands of years to form after the impact event.  Also, fresh craters with dark ejecta are common in Meridiani, and they can't all be extremely recent.\n\r\nDid the crater eject a subsurface layer of dark material? Maybe, but all of the bedrock exposures in the surrounding region are relatively bright. The surface layer is darker than the bedrock because dark materials like hematite concretions (\"blueberries\" found by Opportunity rover) are resistant to wind erosion and get left as a lag deposit. At HiRISE scale the rays are seen to be a thin deposit, perhaps less than 1 meter thick.\n\r\nThe more distant ray segments contain many small secondary craters created by impact of rocks ejected from the primary crater. Maybe these are lag deposits from the original rays.  In other words, a mix of broken-up target material was deposited, but the relatively bright materials have blown away since the crater formed.

High resolution imaging by HiRISE in November 2008 (left panel of the subimage) confirmed that the dark spot was ejecta from a cluster of craters.\n\r\nThree large craters ranging from 3 to 5 meters diameter and at least 5 smaller craters make up the cluster pictured. A smaller outlier (approximately 2 meters in diameter, not pictured in the subimage) landed 300 meters away to the Northwest (bottom right in the non-map projected subimages). These craters were likely produced by a single impactor that broke into pieces as it fell through the Martian atmosphere. \n\r\nThe impactor probably approached from the Northwest, judging from the shape of the ejecta pattern and the location of the small outlier. The impacts sprayed the site with dark ejecta excavated from beneath the bright surface.

By luck, the incidence angle (the zenith angle of the Sun) of the later image was only 0.2 degrees different from that of the earlier image. However, the phase angle (the angle between the Sun, the target, and the camera) was smaller by about 14 degrees as the spacecraft rolled in the opposite direction. \n\r\nThe new picture shows the ejecta pattern apparently faded in comparison to the previous image. The contrast of other features in the scene (such as the hills and boulders at the bottom of the cutout) is similar, but the ejecta from the crater cluster is noticeably brighter in the HiRISE image from 2010. One possibility is that the dark ejecta reflects sunlight differently than the bright surrounding terrain, becoming darker more rapidly as phase angle increases. Another possibility is that the ejecta pattern was mantled by a thin layer of bright dust that settled out of the atmosphere during the 20 month interval between the two images. Further monitoring of this site by HiRISE will help choose between these hypotheses.\n\r\nThis target illustrates how the various instruments on MRO work together.

Glaciers on Mars were once proposed to be likely because of the planet's cold temperatures. The global average temperature of Mars is about -68 Celsius (-90 Fahrenheit). \n\r\nGlacial-looking landforms are now seen to be commonplace, and even abundant in mountainous regions at higher latitudes such as here in Protonilus Mensae. These landforms are quite similar in appearance to glaciers on Earth.\n\r\nThis image shows an example of such a landform. The mountain valley to the North (toward the bottom of the unprojected image) would be the zone of accumulation of snow and ice, which then flowed downhill (toward the top of the image) and out onto a neighboring plain. The evidence of this flow comes from the myriad of stream lines and flow fronts visible in the surface topography. Some of these topographic features may also be \"moraines,\" ridges of rock and soil debris common on the surface of glaciers and at the boundaries. \n\r\nBoulders up to 3 meters (9 feet) in size are visible on the surface of this feature. If you trace the streamlines from these boulders back uphill into the accumulation zone then you'll see where boulders have tumbled off the valley walls before being rafted downhill to their current location.  This process continues today even though the feature itself may not be flowing significantly anymore.\n\r\nOnce onto the more level plain, the ice flow stalled and spread out into a bulb shaped pile where it would have gradually evaporated, called the ablation zone.\" Melting of the ice might have also occurred, though geologic evidence of melting has not yet been found. \n\r\nToday, Mars is very dry place, and surface ice is unstable everywhere except on the polar caps. Any ice left on the surface would evaporate without ever melting, a process called \"sublimation.\" However, past climate changes may have periodically allowed snow and ice to be stable on the Martian surface and even to build into glacial masses, hundreds of meters (yards) or more in thickness.   \n\r\nIn this image, the surface is made up of regolith (rock and soil debris) and no ice is visible. Interestingly, subsurface ice may still be present as relatively soil-free ice, which would then be called a \"debris covered glacier.\" Ice may also occur as a cement between rocky material throughout the glacial deposit and would also be capable of flowing like a glacier, which is called a \"rock glacier.\"   Alternatively, the ice may have all sublimated and what we see now is a residue of the \"glacier till,\" remnant ice-free rock and soil debris. \n\r\nFuture stereo images of this landform will help scientists to understand the surface tilt and the forces driving ice flow under Martian gravity.

The faults are seen to cut the circular rim of the impact crater. Also, the impact did not destroy the adjacent faults. These observations tell us that the fault was active after the impact occurred. \n\r\nIn addition, by measuring the distance of offset of the different pieces of the crater rim separated by the fault line (assuming that when the crater formed, the rim was continuous around its circumference), the amount of movement along the fault can be estimated, laterally and vertically. Faults like these cause troughs to form, called graben, of which the heavily shadowed one is a good example. The center (shadowed) section has been dropped downwards relative to the surrounding terrain, forming the trough.\n\r\nIt is also clear that parts of the crater rim are lower than others where the graben intersects the crater. The sides of the graben (the faults forming the walls of the trough) are sloped, so that the dropped-down part of the crater rim has also moved horizontally away from the higher part of the rim. The combined down-dropping and moving apart indicates that the land here is being stretched and pulled apart, called extension. By measuring the amount of offset on all the faults, we can estimate how much extension has occurred in this part of the planet.\n\r\nThis location is especially helpful because, as mentioned above, we have a good knowledge of the \u0093before-faulting\u0094 configuration of the land, in which the crater rim was continuous. Finally, it is interesting that there is no sign of the fault on the floor of the crater \u0096 the floor has not been faulted and no part is down-dropped and stretched apart as the crater rim has been.

Typical characteristics of slope streaks are initiation at a point source, one streak splitting into two, deflection around or over obstacles such as small boulders or crater rims, widening below the source area up to a few hundred meters, and lengths of up to a few kilometers.\n\r\nNumerous models have been proposed for their formation, both dry- and wet-based. Although there is not one universally accepted model, one key observation up to now was that streaks do not appear to have topographic relief. However, HiRISE images from the first seven months of MRO showed that slope streaks do indeed have topographic relief: the streak interior is lower than its surroundings. There are also many Martian slope streaks that do not appear to have relief; this does not necessarily mean they lack relief, but rather, the relief is below the capability of HiRISE to detect.\n\r\nThe discovery of topographic relief provides an important clue in that sediment had to be removed for the relief to be present. There are several processes, both wet and dry, that can remove material. A small stream of liquid water running over the surface could carve out the streak area, but liquid water exposed at the surface is not stable under current Martian conditions. Water flowing below the surface, covered by an insulating layer of materials is also possible.\n\r\nOther evidence that would favor a wet process are detection of salts, alcoves or channels above the point source, or streaks forming at the intersection of two different geologic layers (i.e., permeable and non-permeable layers). However, there are no documented cases of these thus far. Thus, a dry process is appealing and one of these are dry dust avalanches.\n\r\nFurther analyses of the slope streaks have documented features related to modification of the streaks.

To the south, terrain slopes downward over 4000 meters (13000 feet). Thinking of the crater like a huge drill hole and the canyon wall like a towering road-cut, both features provide a glimpse into the subsurface of the surrounding terrain.\n\r\nIn the curved north wall of the impact crater, and in the East-West trending, upper walls of the canyon (center of the scene), individual layers of rock can be traced laterally over hundreds to thousands of meters (thousands to tens-of-thousands of feet). The layers appear prominently in the wall because they are stronger, steeper, and more resistant to erosion than materials above and below, which form more gradual slopes.\n\r\nIn this scene, darker shadows help to distinguish the steeper, rock layers from lighter, gentler slopes, which are covered with broken rocks and dust. Such layers on Mars may have been deposited by the wind, in water, or by volcanic lava flows or ash falls.

Normally, when an impact into a layered planetary surface occurs, materials from the center of the crater are pushed downward or blown upward and outward (forming the hole in the ground), while the terrain immediately ringing the crater is tilted upwards to form a relatively narrow, sharp rim as exemplified along the north and southeast edge of this crater. However, the southwest rim of this crater is wider, extends further away from the crater center, is not as circular, and contains several discontinuous pieces of ridges. Either this wall of the crater was pushed further outwards and stretched because the impact occurred near the edge of the canyon (basically allowing the impact to push the wall part-ways over the edge of the canyon), or erosion and expansion of the canyon after formation of the crater has partially undercut the crater wall, causing the wall to slump downwards and outwards.\n\r\nIn either case, it may be possible to learn something about the impact-induced damage and disruption caused in the ground below the rim of a crater; about the strength and structure of post-impact materials in the crater wall; about the effects of impacts on layers farther away or below the crater, and about processes of erosion, canyon growth, and crater formation.", "acquisitionDate": "09 May 2010", "localMarsTime": "15:17", "latitude": "-11.727 deg", "longitude": "312.234 deg", "rangeToTargetSite": "262.3 km (163.9 miles)", "imageScaleRange": "26.2 cm/pixel (with 1 x 1 binning) so objects ~79 cm across are resolved"}, "ESP_017693_1795": {"title": "Low Albedo Feature in Aeolis and Zephyria Regions", "link": "https://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/2048/ESP_017693_1795.jpg", "description": "This image is taken of an interesting linear feature in the Aeolis and Zephyria regions.

There is also an abundance of dark sand dunes and other smaller aeolian (wind-driven) bedforms on top of the area of exposed bedrock.  \n\r\nMegabreccia, consisting of very large fragments of pre-existing bedrock, is created by energetic processes, but especially by impact events on Mars. Although megabreccia deposits can coat central uplifts, it may not have been the Stokes impact that made this megabreccia.\n\r\nThe formation of a crater's central uplift does not commonly break up and jumble the deep bedrock.  So if these megabreccias are exposures of the deep bedrock brought up to the surface by the central uplift, and are not merely deposits draped on the central uplift, then it is most likely that these megabreccias were created by much larger and older basin-forming impacts that now lie buried beneath the surface.\n\r\nWith the aid of high-resolution images, and especially the 3D anaglyphs, we hope to decipher whether the materials observed in the central uplift were formed by the host crater or prior to the formation of that crater.

Just as with the ice sheet in Greenland,  this Martian ice sheet contains many layers that record variations in the Martian climate.\n\r\nThese sorts of fluctuations in the thickness of the ice sheet are most pronounced at the edges of the sheet where this HiRISE image was taken. The ice sheet ends here in a gentle scarp that slopes about eight degrees downhill from bottom to top in this image.

Scientists are analyzing these layers to see what information they might hold regarding previous Martian climates.\n\r\nMost of the layers are parallel to each other.  However, if you look more closely at the layers near the base of the slope then you can see that they are orientated at odd angles to each other.  This happens when the ice sheet undergoes the fluctuations in thickness described above. Ice is ablated away and the new ice sheet surface cuts at an angle through several layers. When ice starts being laid down here again, it is in layers parallel to the surface and so at an angle to the older layers. Much later this sloping surface was created by erosion and gives us a cross-sectional view of all the layers and the angles they make with each other. When sloping layers are truncated by flat ones like this geologists call it an angular unconformity.\n\r\nThis location is especially interesting because the ice sheet partly covers an impact crater that is about 17 kilometers (about 10 miles) diameter. You can see the rim of this crater on the flat terrain in the top quarter of the image. The curving crater rim is partly buried by the ice sheet here.

Gullies are a popular target because their formation is still being debated.\n\r\nThe powerful HiRISE camera reveals many details of gullies that have never been seen before. (Searching our catalog for \"gully\" or \"gullies\" will bring up many, many more images of gullies!) Some hypotheses about the formation of gullies involve the flow of some amount of liquid (water, brine, or some other substance), and others postulate that gullies could be formed by the downhill movement of dry material such as dust or sand. To further complicate things, different gullies could have formed by different methods.\n\r\nThe many gullies visible in this image look quite different from each other. This subimage from the southwestern part of the crater to the south shows a gully with a smaller alcove (source region at the top) and a deep main channel. The material in the channel is a different color than the alcove, indicating they may contain different minerals or different grain sizes.\n\nAnother gully in the north part of the same crater  has almost no alcove and very little material deposited at the bottom. However, this gully is marked by a distinct bright-colored deposit along its length. This could be a sign of recent activity where material has moved downhill.\n\nYet another site nearby within the same crater has multiple overlapping gullies of different types. Most of these have large fan-shaped deposits at the bottom, and a few to the left side of the subimage have bright deposits where new material may have been deposited or exposed. Some of the channels and fans contain ripples; this might be where wind eroded loose material, or it may be a texture that formed as sand or liquid moved down the slope. Some of the gully-like features in this image are more likely dry landslide chutes.\n\r\nThis is also a good example of how we use lower-resolution data from other missions, like this previous MOC image, to target the HiRISE camera. A science team member studied the MOC image, and she decided more could be learned by getting a higher-resolution color picture of this site. Now studying this HiRISE image will teach us more about how gullies form. \n\r\nFor more information about gullies in HiRISE images, see these captions as well as many more images in our catalog:\n\nPSP_010567_2360\n\nPSP_007592_1425", "acquisitionDate": "18 July 2009", "localMarsTime": "14:24", "latitude": "-38.695 deg", "longitude": "159.358 deg", "rangeToTargetSite": "262.5 km (164.1 miles)", "imageScaleRange": "52.5 cm/pixel (with 2 x 2 binning) so objects ~158 cm across are resolved"}, "ESP_013726_1475": {"title": "Gullies and Flow Features on Crater Wall", "link": "https://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/2048/ESP_013726_1475.jpg", "description": "This HiRISE image shows a sample of the variety and complexity of processes that may occur on the walls of Martian craters, well after the impact crater formed.\n\nAt the very top of the image is the high crater rim; at the bottom of the image is the crater's central peak: a dome of material rising above the surrounding crater floor uplifted during the impact event.\n\r\nReaching down the walls of the crater are windy and crooked gullies.

This persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south polar residual cap, and is what we are looking at in this HiRISE image.\n\r\nRelatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by semi-circular depressions and linear, branching troughs that make a pattern resembling those of your fingerprints. The high-standing areas are thicknesses of several meters of carbon dioxide ice.

HiRISE is observing this carbon dioxide terrain to try to determine how these patterns develop and how fast the depressions and troughs grow.\n\r\nWhile the south polar residual cap as a whole is present every year, there are certainly changes taking place within it. With the high resolution of HiRISE, we intend to measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over multiple Mars years.

Some Martian craters are similar to these craters, but Mars also has a high proportion of craters with forms not found on the Moon or Mercury: rampart craters.\n\r\nRampart craters, also called fluidized-ejecta craters, have ejecta blankets that appear lobate, or rounded, and end in low ridges or ramparts, such as the ridge in this HiRISE image.

Most of the material that makes up an icy crater is volatile, meaning it can melt or sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas) if heated. Sublimation is more common on Mars because of its thin, dry atmosphere. Crater walls facing the Sun receive more direct light than their surroundings, and are therefore more easily warmed. If the ice in the walls sublimates, the rim structure of the crater becomes degraded.\n\r\nThe impact crater in this image is roughly 900 meters (a little over 0.5 mile) across. The remaining raised rim of the crater is illuminated from the bottom right of the image, causing preferential heating of the interior of the rim structure. The ice appears thin here (more brown material is exposed), with an even thinner cover on the remaining exterior rim. This could be caused by a number of possibilities: perhaps the exterior wall is steeper than the interior wall, resulting in more direct exposure to sunlight, causing more efficient sublimation when the Sun shines on that wall.\n\r\nOnce ice begins to melt, darker dustier material is exposed. The darker material absorbs more heat than white ice (just like standing in the Sun wearing a black shirt makes you warmer than wearing a white shirt, which reflects the Sun's light), causing more and more ice to sublimate near the dark material.

Eskers form in wet-based glaciers, when water flows inside or below the glaciers and deposits sediment. After the ice melts, the sediment is left behind as a ridge.\n\r\nBecause the material is deposited by flowing water, the sediment in eskers is sorted: larger rocks, pebbles, sand grains, etc. are deposited first, and smaller sediment, such as smaller pebbles, sand, or clay, are deposited further from the source and on top of the coarser material. Several factors\u0097including the amount of sediment available, the speed and volume of the flowing water, and the slope over which it flowed\u0097determine how much sediment is deposited and how large the dominant grain size is. There may be many of these sequences preserved within an esker.\n\nEskers look a little like inverted river beds. One relatively simple way to differentiate between the two is that inverted river beds record flow in a downhill direction along their entire length. Eskers, on the other hand, can record flow both down- and uphill. This is possible because water flowing through the ice tunnels in glaciers is under pressure, just like water in a hose.\n\r\nThis particular esker is part of a branching and braided network of ridges in the southern Argyre basin.

The pit craters are believed to form by the collapse of lava tubes or magma chambers. They could also form when the crust of Mars gets pulled apart by extensional forces from a growing volcano magma chamber. This leaves structurally weak areas that have a greater chance of collapsing when the area (lava tubes or magma chamber) no longer contains molten lava or is drained from the chamber. \n\r\nThere is evidence that Mars is not the only planet that has features like these. Earth also has similar pit chains that have formed in Iceland. This chain was formed on a known fault line and the pits formed when the region experienced an earthquake. \n\r\nThis process may be similar to the way the Martian pit chains were formed. If \"Marsquakes\" are the cause of the formation of pit chains, this will support the idea that there is still geologic (tectonic) activity occurring on Mars. The pit chains that have been found on Earth are considerably smaller than similar features that are found on Mars. Earth's are smaller due to higher gravity and weathering makes them smaller and at some point completely erasing them from sight.

(For an appreciation of the dimensions of this crater, see the anaglyph for Zumba.) Zumba is approximately 25 percent deeper than the average Martian crater of this size -- just one of several attributes that suggests it is a very fresh crater.\n\r\nOne estimate of Zumba's age, generally accomplished by counting smaller superimposed craters on Zumba itself, suggests it may be 5 million years young. Even if such an estimate is off by 2-4 times, this is still a young geologic feature by Mars standards. Because Zumba is so young and so fresh, it is a perfect example of a simple crater.  On Mars, a simple crater is generally less than 6-9 km (about 3.7-5.6 mi) in diameter with a \u00e2\u0080\u009csimple\u00e2\u0080\u009d conical-bowl shape, minimal wall collapse, and lacking a well-developed central feature (e.g., a peak, large pit, or ring). \n\r\nBy impacting into such hard durable rocks, the impact that created Zumba scattered greater than 10 million ejecta blocks at high speeds resulting in far-reaching ray segments and an impressive field of secondary impact craters (see the subimage). This pattern is hard to see in visible-light images, but \u00e2\u0080\u009clights-up\u00e2\u0080\u009d spectacularly in nighttime thermal infrared images taken by THEMIS onboard the Mars Odyssey 2001 Orbiter (see Gratteri Crater's Far-Flung Rays). Scientists believe that some of these high-speed rocks may have even been expelled from Mars and even traveled to Earth (see Did Martian Meteorites Come From These Sources?).\n\r\nZumba is of considerable interest to scientists, whether it's a source of Martian meteorites or not, as it possesses interesting features that are typically buried or eroded away in other older Martian craters, and even within the freshest terrestrial craters (including Meteor crater in Arizona; see Meteor crater in Google Earth: Meteor crater.kmz). These preserved and newly recognized features observed at the scale of HiRISE may reveal aspects of the impact process unknown to scientists from previous studies of craters on the terrestrial planets. \n\r\nWhat is particularly intriguing is the presence of a pitted deposit giving Zumba the appearance that it has a relatively flat floor despite the pits. These crater-fill deposits are typically composed of lightly to highly damaged rock fragments and impact melts formed from the high temperatures achieved from the energy released by the impact event (i.e., on the order several to tens of megatons). The pits in the crater-fill deposits have not been recognized within lunar or terrestrial craters and appear to be unique to crater-fill deposits in only the freshest and best-preserved Martian craters.\n\r\nThese pits may represent the result of the interactions of the very hot crater-fill deposits with water and water-ice that may have been present in the subsurface prior to impact. It is not well understood whether these pits form explosively (similar to terrestrial volcanic pits/craters formed from the interaction of hot lava with wet sediments/deposits), or by collapse from the drainage of impact melts or volatiles.

This type of bowl-shaped crater is called a simple crater. It's \u201csimple\u201d compared to larger craters that have terraces, central peaks and rings, and other, more complex, shapes. \n\r\nWhy should we care about such a small, plain crater? One reason is that it's extremely young. The large craters we see on Mars are millions to several billion years old, but this crater formed between January 2006 and May 2008. That means it was only a few months to a few years old when HiRISE observed it. We know this because we have been studying Mars with multiple missions over a long time period, and we can compare images of the same area and detect changes. In this case, the Context camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took an image that had a dark spot in it. (To see the dark spot in the CTX image, look near the middle of this image, to the left of the central group of little hills.)  When this was compared to a previous image from the THEMIS instrument, the dark spot wasn't there. Therefore, we know it must have formed between the dates those two images were taken.\n\r\nThe Context camera has a lower resolution than HiRISE, in order to cover more area. A single pixel is about the same size as this crater. So that Context image can't resolve the crater; all that's visible is a dark spot. When HiRISE followed up on the detection and returned this more detailed image, we could see that the dark spot is actually a much larger area surrounding this tiny crater. The dark area that allows us to detect these new impacts is probably the result of lighter-colored dust being blown off the surface by the impact event.\n\r\nAt this site, there are also some streaks of dark material that was ejected out of the ground.

The ejecta blanket is composed of materials which are resistant to erosion and coat surface material around the crater causing it to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Eventually, erosion of the topmost layers of the surrounding plains cause the crater and ejecta to appear as if standing upon a raised platform or pedestal. Features such as this on Mars are called pedestal craters. In this example, the eroding ejecta has ragged edges with some detached mesas and buttes and resistant layers in the ejecta are forming steep and overhanging cliffs.\n\r\nEmerging from the rock beneath the pedestal crater is an inverted flat-topped channel. Similar to the pedestal craters, inverted channels occur when former channel depressions become elevated because materials that fill the depressions are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. For example, a depression may become filled with lava that is more resistant to erosion than the surrounding surface, or gravel or boulders transported in a high energy flow that protect underlying material from erosion, or sediments deposited by a flowing stream that have become cemented. \n\r\nIn this image, the pedestal crater superposes the flat-topped ridge indicating that it is younger and formed after the channel. Therefore the channel formed first, possibly a result of water flowing on the surface. Resistant materials were deposited on the flat channel floor and the channel was later filled and buried by sediments.\n\r\nEven later, a meteorite impacted the surface of sediments above the channel forming a crater and ejecta blanket of resistant materials that protected underlying materials from being blown away and eroded.

This is a large area with abundant sedimentary rocks forming a stack hundreds of meters thick, and now being eroded into a landscape reminiscent of the southwestern United States. \n\r\nThe timescale involved in depositing and eroding these layers is evident from the remnant impact craters preserved here. The large arc in the image is the rim of one crater; the smaller, circular dark spots are traces of other impacts. Light sediments are found both inside and outside the large crater, indicating that this crater formed during the period of sediment deposition. It is likely that this depression, which was probably more than a kilometer deep when it formed, was completely filled and buried and is now being exhumed.

These buried craters are generally inaccessible to us, but in a few rare locations, erosion that forms a trough (like this one) can uncover these buried structures.

Neither crater shows signs of burial by ejecta from the other. More importantly, the ejecta (material thrown out of the craters) shows signs of interacting; the ridges extending to the southeast of the crater probably formed when ejecta from the craters collided in midair, causing more debris to pile up at certain points.

However, sharper-looking features such as the crater and the long landslide scars (250 x 375 meters, or 270 x 410 yards) show that the fuzzy look is not an artifact of the image, but rather indicative of an extremely smooth surface. That smoothness is due to a thick layer of dust blanketing the landscape.\n\r\nHow do we know this is dust? The lines of evidence below indicate that this is the case.\n\r\nSurface temperature measurements performed from satellites orbiting Mars show that these materials get relatively warm during the day (when they are illuminated by the Sun) and very cold at night. Rocks or sand would not experiment such large temperature oscillations between day and night. That is, dust has lower thermal inertia than rocks and sand. \n\r\nAlso, dust is uniformly bright (light) in color. Fine-grained materials are generally lighter in color that their coarser-grained counterparts, because of the way light is scattered (bounced) by fine particles. Martian dust has consistently a very light, reddish color, characteristic of the oxidized (rusty) iron in it.\n\r\nAnother piece of evidence is that even though these materials are loose (as shown by the landslides), they are not movable by wind (demonstrated by the lack of dunes.

The top of the image (to the north) shows the lobate edge of the apron, where it stopped flowing.\n\r\nRecently, the SHARAD (Shallow ground-penetrating radar) instrument (also on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with HiRISE) measured large amounts of water ice mixed into this and other debris aprons.  The water ice is what gives the apron its unique texture, which is especially clear at HiRISE's high resolution.

Debris aprons like this one have fewer craters than their surroundings. Because impacts generally occur indiscriminately over all of Mars, this means that either the debris apron is younger than its surroundings, or some process is erasing craters on the apron - a process which is not occurring as rapidly on the surrounding plains.\n\r\nThe fact that this apron is rich in water ice is a clue to what is happening. Another clue is the craters on the apron themselves: they have a different appearance than most craters.  Some of these degraded craters are \"inverted\" (higher in the middle than at the edges, which is the opposite of normal craters).\n\r\nCraters like this have been modified, so we can tell the surface has been active at some time since the impact that formed the crater.

The dark patches and streaks show sand that has begun escaping from a blanket of seasonal frost.\n\r\nMany of the typical types of Martian dunes are similar to common dunes on Earth. Transverse  dunes have gentle upwind slopes and steep lee sides that are perpendicular to the wind direction. Barchans are crescent-shaped dunes with a gentle upwind slope and steep lee with horns. Other common dunes on Earth and Mars are seif dunes that form sinuous parallel ridges with bi-directional winds forming the slip-faces.\n\r\nThe dune types in this image transition from transverse in the south through tight chains of barchans, to the strange, elongated dunes in the north. These elongated dunes appear to be modified barchans with two slip-faces and asymmetric horns. The drawn out limbs and remnant slip-faces were apparently produced by variations in the wind direction. The winds that created the transverse dunes blow from a single easterly direction, while the modified barchans are shaped by winds from an easterly-northeasterly direction. The elongated horns align parallel to northeasterly winds. These wind variations could be caused by local topography.\n\r\nTwo factors likely contribute to the unique morphology of these dunes. First, the southern horns defrost sooner than the northern horns because they receive sunlight more directly. This enables material to move more easily on their southern side. Second, the changing wind directions may be reorienting the dunes. One idea is that the barchans\u0092 southern horns are being blown downwind into linear (seif-like) dunes, with sinuous crests and steep flanks. Another possible explanation is that they are drifts of sand (lee dunes) that form in the lee of an obstacle. The frozen barchans might act as obstacles to the wind, allowing loose sand to accumulate in their lee.

Their formation most likely involves development of oval- to scalloped-shaped depressions that may coalesce together, leading to the formation of large areas of pitted terrain. Scalloped pits typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. \n\r\nOn the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions is a polygonal pattern of fractures. This is commonly associated with scalloped terrain, and indicates that the surface has undergone stress, potentially caused by subsidence (sinking), desiccation (drying out), or thermal contraction. These polygon features are similar to permafrost polygons that form in polar and high alpine regions on Earth by seasonal-to-annual contraction of the subsoil. On Earth, such polygon features are indicative of the presence of ground ice. Several cracks cut through the side of the scallops suggesting that they must be at least as deep as the scallops.

Material, likely including fine-grained ice and dust and possibly including large blocks, has detached from a towering cliff and cascaded to the gentler slopes below. The occurrence of the avalanches is spectacularly revealed by the accompanying clouds of fine material that continue to settle out of the air. The largest cloud (upper images) traces the path of the debris as it fell down the slope, hit the lower slope, and continues downhill, forming a billowing cloud front. This cloud is about 180 meters across and extends about 190 meters from the base of the steep cliff. Shadows to the lower left of each cloud illustrate further that these are three dimensional features hanging in the air in front of the cliff face, and not markings on the ground (sun is from the upper right). \n\r\nCameras orbiting Mars have taken thousands of images that have enabled scientists to put together pieces of Mars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 geologic history.

Some images taken at different times of year do show seasonal changes from one image to the next; however, it is extremely rare to catch such a dramatic event in action. (Another, unrelated, active process that has been captured by Mars cameras are dust devils.) Observing currently active processes is often a useful tool in unlocking puzzles of the past for scientists studying the Earth. Working from primarily still images, it is harder for scientists studying Mars to rely on this tool. The HiRISE image of avalanching debris is a very rare opportunity to directly do so. \n\r\nThe scarp in this image is on the edge of the dome of layered deposits centered on Mars\u2019 North Pole. From top to bottom this impressive cliff is over 700 meters tall and reaches slopes over 60 degrees. The top part of the scarp, to the left of the images, is still covered with bright (white) carbon dioxide frost which is disappearing from the polar regions as spring progresses. The upper mid-toned (pinkish-brownish) section is composed of layers (difficult to see here) that are mostly ice with varying amounts of dust. The darkest deposits below form more gentle slopes, less than 20 degrees, and are mainly composed of two materials: mid-toned layers, possibly ice-rich, that form small shelves, and more mobile, widespread, sand-sized dark material. The wavy forms on the flatter areas to the right are dunes.\n\r\nThe upper, steepest section, which appears highly fractured due to blocks pulling away from the wall, is the likely source zone for the falls. The precise trigger mechanism is not yet known, although the disappearance of the carbon dioxide frost, the expansion and contraction of the ice in response to temperature differences, a nearby Mars-quake or meteorite impact, and vibrations caused by the first fall in the area, are all possible contributors. \n\r\nBy comparing images taken before the fall and after the fall, we may be able to see where material has disappeared from the steep scarp and where it has appeared on the gentler slopes below, possibly as larger blocks, diffuse streaks, or other debris deposits. By imaging this scarp throughout the polar summer, we may be able to determine how much material falls over a given time period. These observations will help determine how much, and at what rate, ice is being eroded from the cliff. Understanding the processes and rates of erosion also help determine how the polar landscape has evolved, and help reveal how volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide ices and gases, move around Mars.\n\r\nThe precise composition of the ice-dust mixture making up layers in the upper, steepest section of scarp is unknown.

The fault is the thin, diagonal line that cuts through most of the image, from near the lower left corner to near the upper right corner. On each side of the fault, the layers that cross the fault are slightly off-set from one other; in other words, the layers don't line-up with each other anymore. The relationship between the angles at which the layers and fault are exposed and the movement along the fault is complex, but, in general, the layers on the left side of the fault are slightly lower than those on the right.  \n\r\nFaults are created when rock (or, in this case, water ice) breaks due to some outside force and rocks (or ice) along either side of that break move in opposite directions. One of the most famous faults on Earth is the San Andreas Fault in California. There is a crack between the floor of the Pacific Ocean, plus a little bit of the California and Mexico coastline, and the rest of North America; the Pacific Ocean floor is moving northward along that crack, but North America is moving southward. Because the two sides are grinding against each other, they sometime stick together and then move again in jerky fashion, much like the way if you try to rub pieces of rough sand paper together. When movement along the fault occurs after a period of sticking together, this creates an earthquake.\n\r\nFor the case of this fault on Mars, it is unlikely that a \"Marsquake\" occurred when movement happened along this fault, because it is so small (over 1000 times shorter than the San Andreas Fault). This is interesting because faults are rare in the Martian polar layered deposits. The fault may have been created during widespread flow of the SPLD. Some of the stiffer ice could not flow and broke instead. Ice can only flow fast enough to create faults when it is relatively warm.

Together, these processes cause an ice sheet to undergo accumulation (build-up). Ablation (removal of material, also called erosion) of an ice sheet can also occur. If more accumulation happens than ablation, the ice sheet grows; if reversed, the ice sheet shrinks, as is the case for many of Earth\u0092s glaciers due to global warming. Each year, the amount of accumulation and ablation varies, so layers of different thicknesses and different amounts of impurities (dust) will be deposited onto the ice sheet.\n\r\nVolcanic eruptions anywhere on the planet can also potentially spew ash high into the atmosphere, where it can travel great distances and fall onto an ice sheet surface.

Thus, layers in an ice sheet can originate through a variety of means and occur at a variety of scales (thicknesses).   \n\r\nThis particular image is interesting because many layers are exposed and because more than one outcrop (exposure of layering) is visible\u2014at the top of the image and at the bottom. You can imagine the outcrops at the top and bottom of the image as if you are looking down on a staircase. The approximately horizontal lines are the edges of the layers (the risers), and the flat areas between them are the layer surfaces (the flat parts of the steps). The middle of the image is the top of the staircase.  At the bottom, the staircase of layers goes down again.\n\r\nThe layers in this image are on the scale of meters (several to tens of feet) in thickness and are much thicker than one might expect from annual accumulation (which might be about 0.5 millimeters per year, or 0.02 inch per year). So the layers we see in this image may be packages of thinner, annual layers. The reason that we can distinguish between different packages of annual layers (in other words, the reason that we can see layering at this scale) is because the rates of accumulation and ablation change not only yearly, but also on much longer time scales. Imagine drilling into the SPLD and looking at the walls of the hole with a microscope. Within the large-scale layering we see in this image, we might see annual accumulation layers, dusty layers created during large dust storms, and maybe even volcanic ash layers.", "acquisitionDate": "25 July 2007", "localMarsTime": "16:24", "latitude": "-84.219 deg", "longitude": "229.148 deg", "rangeToTargetSite": "248.4 km (155.3 miles)", "imageScaleRange": "from 24.9 cm/pixel (with 1 x 1 binning) to 49.7 cm/pixel (with 2 x 2 binning)"}, "PSP_003655_1885": {"title": "Layered Mound in a Crater", "link": "https://static.uahirise.org/images/wallpaper/2048/PSP_003655_1885.jpg", "description": "This image shows a portion of a mound partly filling an impact crater.

Because Mars is so much colder, however, the seasonal ice that is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring (generally analogous to winter time snow on Earth) is carbon dioxide ice. Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter&emdash;this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap.\n\r\nRelatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions, forming a pattern called \"swiss cheese\" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses probably of several meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). By looking at different sized depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of \"swiss cheese\" terrain can be observed.\n\r\nThe sublimation process may begin anywhere as a small depression. Once this small depression is formed, it expands laterally in all directions, creating the rounded depressions we see today. As most depressions seem to have a similar depth and have relatively flat bottoms, there is likely some layer below, possibly of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Thus, while the south polar residual cap as a whole is present every year, there are certainly annual changes taking place within it. \n\r\nEspecially apparent and interesting in this image are the strips of material that parallel the edges of many depressions. Often there are two or more concentric strips that are smooth like the surrounding surface, but seem to be lower than the surrounding surface and in places appear to be tilted down towards the center of the depression. Inner strips are sometimes broken up into chunks. It may be that the uppermost smooth layer is a bit more resistant to sublimation than the material just below it&emdash;the quicker removal of the underlying material might cause the stronger upper layer to detach from the surrounding terrain and settle down towards the center of the depression. \n\r\nAlternatively, these ringing strips may indicate that many layers are present within the carbon dioxide ice. Another interesting feature is the faint crisscrossing network of ridges on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice.\n\r\nWith the high resolution capability of HiRISE, we intend to measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years.

The ridge is most likely a former streambed, now exposed in inverted relief; the wandering path is not expected for an exhumed fault or volcanic dyke.

This could be due to a change in the properties of the layers at given levels of the crater; materials of various strengths may erode at different rates. It might also reflect local slopes or erosional processes. This area looks darker-toned from a distance, but this appears to be due to partial covering of some of the layers by dark sand. A large sheet of sand is visible at the southern (bottom) edge of the image. \n\r\nMany small faults are visible throughout the layers, expressed as small discontinuities and offsets; these indicate places where tectonic stresses have caused the layered deposits to break and shift. \n\r\nThe origin of such layers is not certain. Materials a few hundred kilometers away have been explored by NASA's Opportunity rover, and are sandstone formed by ancient dunes; the same could be true at this site, as sandstone on Earth often forms extensive layered deposits.

What is particularly interesting about these gullies is that the heads (tops) of the gullies are located at many elevations along the same slope, and that each elevation with gullies has an associated set of layers.\n\r\nOne thing to notice is that often a layer correlated with a gully is most eroded where the gully occurs. (See, for example, the gullies located in the bottom center of the image and the subimage,). At the bottom center, there are two gullies present, and the layer where they appear to originate is most eroded where the gullies exist. In the subimage, the deeper gully channels correspond to locations where the layers have been more eroded. This suggests that undermining may be occurring. Undermining often happens when water from the subsurface reaches the surface and destabilizes nearby material. The water erodes material in its way, which can create an overhang. Once this overhang becomes unstable, it will collapse.\n\r\nThis might be the reason that the layers are the most eroded near the gullies. It would support a subsurface origin for the water that formed these gullies. Undermining can also be generated by surface water if a weak, easily erodible layer lies beneath a stronger layer.\n\r\nFor more information, see Gulick, V.C. et al.

The frost is likely water frost, as opposed to carbon dioxide, because temperatures at this latitude probably do not get cold enough for carbon dioxide to condense.\n\r\nThe formation mechanism of gullies is much debated. Several theories support erosion by liquid water, while others favor dry debris flows or carbon dioxide.  A major unknown is, if the gullies are formed by liquid water, does the water originate from the surface or subsurface? Dendritic structures, such as those seen in the alcove displayed in the subimage (approximately 1.3 km across; 2560 x 3000, 7MB), form from surface runoff on Earth. Water originating in the subsurface would not produce a structure like this. This alcove is evidence for a surface source for the water possibly required to form gullies.\n\r\nAlso interesting about this scene is the fact that the gullies occur at multiple elevations along the same crater wall. This is uncommon on Mars. Gullies, whether or not they are found in conjunction with an obvious horizontal layer, usually form at the same elevation on a given slope.  It is unknown what caused these gullies to form at multiple elevations.
